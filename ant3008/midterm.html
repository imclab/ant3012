# Mid-term (Processing)

**Your Sogang student number:** __________________________________________________________________

## Part 1: Quiz

**Each of the following statements is either true or false.   
Mark the ones you think are *true*.**

- If I want code to execute continuously, I should put it in the ```setup``` function
- If the same number is used in many places, I can replace it with a variable
- If there is a property that can change over time, I should use a variable
- If several parts of my code look the same, I can replace them with a new function
- If I want something to happen 10 times, I can use an ```if``` statement
- I can store the value 3.141592653589793 in a variable of type ```int```
- I can store the value 10 in a variable of type ```float```
- When I run the following program, it will gradually fill the screen with of randomly positioned circles:
```java
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  background(0);
  ellipse(random(400), random(400), 40, 40);
}
```

----

**For each of the following questions, only one answer is correct. 
Mark the *only* one that you think is true.**

I want to draw a square with a circle inside it. Why doesn't this program do what I want?

```java
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  ellipse(200, 200, 40, 40);
  rect(100, 100, 200, 200);
}
```
- I need to make the ellipse bigger
- I should change the order of the ```ellipse``` and ```rect``` instructions
- I should draw the ellipse during ```setup()```
- I need to use background()

In the following program, at what X position is the point drawn?

```java
void draw() {
  translate(10, 0);
  pushMatrix();
    translate(10, 0);
    pushMatrix();
      translate(10, 0);
    popMatrix();
    translate(10, 0);
    point(10, 0);		// what is the X coordinate of this point?
  popMatrix();  
}
```

- 10 pixels
- 30 pixels
- 40 pixels
- 50 pixels

In the following program, how many times will the following loop run (how many times is ```println``` called)?

```java
for (int i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
    println(i);
}
```

- 0 times
- 5 times
- 6 times
- 7 times

----

**For each of the following questions, more than one answer may be true! 
Mark *all* the answers that you think are correct.**

I want to print out the number of times the mouse has been clicked. I wrote the program below, but it doesn't work properly. What can I do to fix it?

```java
void draw() {
  int count = 0;
  if (mousePressed) {
    count = count + 1;
  } else {
    count = 0;
  }
  println(count);
}
```

- The variable ```count``` should be defined at the top of the program (outside the ```draw()``` function).
- The code should be moved into a ```mouseClicked()``` function.
- Use a for loop.
- None of these changes will fix it.

I want my program to have a black background when the mouse is pressed down, and a white background when the mouse button is released. Which of the following programs work?

- Program 1:
```java 
void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    background(0);
  } else {
    background(255);
  }
}
```
- Program 2:
```java 
int bg = 255;
void draw() {
  background(bg);
}
void mousePressed() {
   bg = 0;
}
void mouseReleased() {
   bg = 255; 
}
```
- It is impossible to write a program that does this

## Part 2: Project

Sketch an animated or interactive logo for Art & Technology. First, draw an **A**, a **+** and a **T**, but *don't use fonts; draw them using rects, lines, ellipses or other shapes!* Then make them move (either by themselves, or in response to the mouse.) 

You can consult the class notes and Processing reference online, but remember you don't have much time to finish!

# Submitting your work

To submit a sketch to your OpenProcessing portfolio:

- Go to [OpenProcessing.org](http://www.openprocessing.org/) and sign in.
- Go to the *my portfolio* page and click on *create new sketch*
- Copy your Processing code from the Processing editor and paste it into the webpage, and click *save*
- Add a title for your work, and a description if you like.
- Again click *save*

To submit one of your portfolio works to the classroom assignment sub-collection:

- Go to [the classroom collection](http://www.openprocessing.org/classroom/2619)
- Click on the *Select a sketch* button
- Click on the sketch you want to submit
- Now move this sketch into the proper assignment sub-collection.

We can create other variables in our programs too, and read and change the data they contain. To do this, we need to learn another detail first. In Processing, and many other programming languages, variables also have a **type**, which never changes. The type of a variable defines what *kinds* of data it can contain. For example, **int** type variables always contain integers, which are whole numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3 etc. They cannot contain any other kind of data. So whenever we introduce a new variable name to the program (we *declare* it), we also need to tell Processing what type of data it will contain.
