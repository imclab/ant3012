# Digital Media Art Workshop  
Spring 2014

**Course Number:** ANT3008  
**Credit:** 3  
**Enrollment Eligibility:** 2, 3, 4  
**Class Time:** Mon 15:00~16:15, Wed 16:30~17:45      
**Classroom:**  
**Instructors:** Hyunkyung (Haru) Ji     
**Office:** X407 (Hours: Fri 14:00 - 18:00) meeting will be set up by mail.

The goal of this class is for students to learn how to create visual and audio expressions through programming, using the most widely used media arts tools today: [Processing](http://www.processing.org) and [Max/MSP/Jitter](http://www.cycling74.com). Both tools are designed for artists to create computational art using algorithmic techniques. The class starts at beginner level and will end at an intermediate level. Students will do a small assignment each week, and for the mid- and final-term evaluation, they will submit one Processing project and one Max/MSP/Jitter project along with one quiz each (10 to 20 questions) respectively.

Students will learn: 

- How to use Processing and Max/MSP/Jitter (technique) and how to create visual and audio systems and art (expression).
- What is computational art, and what are its structure and components. What is programming, and what are its structure and components. 
- What to express: gain good understanding of the differences of digital media, and computational audio/visual expression.

Creating and expressing sensory data with computers (computational arts) asks students for a very strong interdisciplinarity (especially between liberal arts, science and engineering) and an open-minded attitude. It is very important to develop an open and dedicated mind-set.

### Prerequisites 

Willing motivation and an open-minded perspective.

### Course format

This class takes a workshop format conducted at the AS111 lab, using computers and computer software. 

- Half of the class will be lecture-based, showing the theory and practice using presentation media and software (50%). 
- The other half will be practice-based, oriented toward work by students (50%).

Questions and discussions are encouraged during the class time.

### Evaluation

- Assignments (30%). Small assignments every week to evaluate how students follow the each week’s topics.
- Mid-term: 
	- one creative Processing project & presentation (25%),
	- and quiz (10%). 
- Final-term: 
	- one creative MAX/MSP project & presentation (25%),
	- and quiz (10%).

When you submit your work, please name your assignment as the following format: yourSchoolid\_name\_date.extension

### Course policies

Accessing the software:

- Processing is the open software and supports cross-platform. Please download and install from [http://processing.org/](http://processing.org/).
- Max/MSP is commercial software and supports Mac OSX and Windows. You can [download a demo version](http://www.cycling74.com) for a month's use or you can [purchase a student-priced  version](http://cycling74.com/shop/individual-academic/) if you don’t have other access to the software. The TA will have USB dongles with Max/MSP/Jitter licenses available for use during class times.

Regular update (at least once a week) of your work, delivered in time, is important and will be reflected to the grade.

Students must bring __headphones/earphones__ to use in the AS111 lab. Students should use __a USB stick or web hard space__ to save their work, since **the computers in AS111 are wiped daily**.

Support for the disabled: seat support, extensions on homework and project submissions, TA support etc. is provided.


### Software to download & install:

- [Java runtime](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)
- [Processing](http://processing.org/download/)
- [Max/MSP/Jitter 6.1 (32-bit)](http://cycling74.com)
- [Quicktime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/) -- install Quicktime AFTER Max/MSP/Jitter, otherwise it will need to be installed again 
- [PACE Interlok extensions](http://www.paceap.com/dldrvr.html), to support the Max license dongles 
- [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)
