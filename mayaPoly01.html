# Maya modeling workshop
## NURBs review: more surfaces, creating 3D text applying *Bevel*
(Create / Text )

### *Export* and *Import* meshes into your new scene. 
(File / Export Selection... ) & (File/ Import... ) 
### Let's use .obj file format. 
(if you don't have [.obj file format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file), go Window /Settings/Preferences / **Plug-in Manager**, and turn on **objExport.bundle**) 

## Polygon modeling

![mm01](img/maya/polygon/mm.png)  

Polygons are straight-sided shapes (3 or more sides), defined by three-dimensional points (vertices) and the straight lines that connect them (edges). The interior region of the polygon is called the face. 
When many faces are connected together they create a network of faces called a **polygon mesh** (also referred to as a polyset or a polygonal object).

### Polygon component
**Vertices, edges, and faces** are the basic components of polygons. 
When you model with polygons you usually use three-sided polygons called triangles or four-sided polygons called quadrilaterals (quads). Maya also supports the creation of polygons with more than four sides (n-gons) but they are not as commonly used for modeling.

### Shading

### Texturing

![tex01](img/maya/polygon/texturing.png) 

### Non-manifold, 2-manifold

- Polygonal geometry can have different configurations or ***topology*** types in Maya. Understanding the characteristics of these topologies can be helpful when you need to understand why a modeling operation failed to execute as expected.

- **Two-manifold topology polygons** have a configuration such that the polygon mesh can be split along its various edges and subsequently unfolded so that the mesh lays flat without overlapping pieces.

- **Non-manifold topology polygons** have a configuration that cannot be unfolded into a continuous flat piece. Some tools and actions in Maya cannot work properly with non-manifold geometry. For example, the legacy ***Boolean*** algorithm and the ***Reduce*** feature do not work with non-manifold polygon topology. The image below shows three examples of non-manifold topology polygons.

#### Boolean

### Virtual vs. Real

>### Toplogy  
>####[Wolfram mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Topology.html), [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
>- Topology: (1) The mathematical study of object's properties that are preserved through **deformations**, **twistings**, and **stretchings** of objects. Tearing, however, is not allowed. (2) A set along with a collection of subsets that satisfy several defining properties. [Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/classroom/TopologicalSpace.html)

>- Q: What is a topologist? A: Someone who cannot distinguish between a doughnut and a coffee cup. 

>- Topology is the mathematical study of **shapes** and **spaces**. It is a major area of mathematics concerned with the most basic properties of space, such as *connectedness*, *continuity* and *boundary*. It is the study of properties that are preserved under continuous deformations including stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Topology developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of such concepts as space, dimension, and transformation. e.g. Möbius strips is a kind of object studied in topology, which has only one surface and one edge.

## Review
- [Tumblr](http://2014ant3012.tumblr.com/)
- ADs (supplementary class and so on): [Dynamic Structure & Fluid conference &  workshop](http://www.arkoartcenter.or.kr/nr2/?c=24/41&sort=order_uid&orderby=desc&uid=12716)
	- Change our class time to 10:30 from 1:30 on only this Friday and if it works, I will do two supplementary class on the other Friday morning.
	
## Homework by April 9
- Upload one image of your 3D name applying Boolean operation into Tumblr.

## Class Schedule adjustment (April 3rd, Thursday posting)

This is the schedule for 3D Maya modeling & texturing class before the mid-term.
There will be no attendance checks for the supplemental classes.

- April 4th Friday: no class
- April 8th Tuesday: 6:00 ~ 7:15 - More on Curve editing (1st supplemental class)  
- April 9th Wednesday: 1:30 ~ 2:45 - Polygon modeling I
- April 11th Friday: 1:30 ~ 2:45 - Shading & Lighting I
- April 15th Tuesday: 6:00 ~ 7:15 - Virtual filmmaking  (2nd supplemental class)
- April 16th Wednesday: 1:30 ~ 2:45 - More on Shading & Lighting I
- After mid-term  (3rd supplemental class)

## Mid-term: 
- **April 23rd: Quiz**

- Submit **a folder** including 1. a rendering image (Full HD: 1024 * 768, using one of jpg / png / tif) of your room (naturally) or object (unique), 2. one pdf showing your sketch + research/references.

# Polygon modeling practice
## Basic exercise:
     
- Function: Polygon component mode (F8 or choose the object and press right mouse button) & Polygon object mode (transformation + shape + Input node (upstream construction, history))
### Create Polygon: Create Polygon or Using Polygon primitives.
Maya primitives
![pri](img/maya/polygon/primitives.png)
	- Creating Polygon from scratch: Polygon // Mesh / Create Polygon Tool    
	- Using primitives: Create / Polygon Primitives
### Polygon Editing	
	- Delete vertices, edges, and faces
	- Merge vertices, edges, and faces
	- Transform vertices, edges, and faces
	- Append the deleted faces (Polygons/Mesh/Edit Mesh/Append to Polygon Tool)
	- Split faces using snap (Polygons/Mesh/Edit Mesh/Interactive Split Tool) 
	- Extrude (Polygons/Mesh/Edit Mesh), check Keep Faces Together: Select a face or multiple faces of a polygon, and choose Edit Mesh ⇒ Extrude. The regular Manipulator changes to a Special Manipulator.
### Modeling Toolkit 
Modeling Toolkit used to be a plug-in called NEX that is now integrated with Maya 2014. It integrates component-level selection and editing tools (such as selecting vertices, edges, faces, etc., and extruding them, for example) together for a more streamlined modeling workflow.

![mt02](img/maya/polygon/modelingToolkit.png)
	
- Concept
	- Delete History (Edit/Delete by Type/History):	
	This operaton deletes all upstream construction history.     
	Check Channel Box and Hypergraph	 
	
## First Polygon modeling project: Creating your studio

![st](img/maya/shading/studio.png)

## Creating your desk:
 
-  Polygons: (Polygons/Mesh/) & (Polygons/Mesh/Edit Mesh) 
	1. Make a plan.
	2. Collect your reference and draw your own sketches.
	3. Start from Polygon primitives (Create/Polygon Primitives).
	4. Use Deformation or Edit Mesh operations (use Layer editor -> reference mode + snap) to build your furniture.
