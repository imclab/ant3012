# Maya modeling workshop

## Polygon modeling
Polygons are straight-sided shapes (3 or more sides), defined by three-dimensional points (vertices) and the straight lines that connect them (edges). The interior region of the polygon is called the face. 
When many faces are connected together they create a network of faces called a polygon mesh (also referred to as a polyset or a polygonal object).

#### Polygon component
**Vertices, edges, and faces** are the basic components of polygons. 
When you model with polygons you usually use three-sided polygons called triangles or four-sided polygons called quadrilaterals (quads). Maya also supports the creation of polygons with more than four sides (n-gons) but they are not as commonly used for modeling.

>### Toplogy  
>####[Wolfram mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Topology.html), [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
>- Topology: (1) The mathematical study of object's properties that are preserved through **deformations**, **twistings**, and **stretchings**. (2) A set along with a collection of subsets that satisfy several defining properties. [Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/classroom/TopologicalSpace.html)

>- Topology is the mathematical study of the properties that are preserved through deformations, twistings, and stretchings of objects. Tearing, however, is not allowed. 
- Q: What is a topologist? A: Someone who cannot distinguish between a doughnut and a coffee cup. 

>- Topology is the mathematical study of **shapes** and **spaces**. It is a major area of mathematics concerned with the most basic properties of space, such as *connectedness*, *continuity* and *boundary*. It is the study of properties that are preserved under continuous deformations including stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. The exact mathematical definition is given below. Topology developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of such concepts as space, dimension, and transformation. e.g. MÃ¶bius strips is a kind of object studied in topology, which has only one surface and one edge.

### First Polygon modeling project: building a desk

Basic exercise:
     
- Function: work on Polygon component mode (F8 or choose the object and press right mouse button) & Polygon object mode (transformation + shape + Input node (upstream construction, history)
	- Delete vertices, edges, and faces
	- Merge vertices, edges, and faces
	- Transform vertices, edges, and faces
	- Split faces using snap (Polygons/Mesh/Edit Mesh/Interactive Split Tool) 
	- Extrude (Polygons/Mesh/Edit Mesh), and check Keep Faces Together.   
	
- Concept
	- History
	Delete History (Edit/Delete by Type/History):	
	This operaton deletes all upstream construction history.     
	Check Channel Box and Hypergraph

Making:
 
-  Polygons: Polygons/Mesh/ and Polygons/Mesh/Edit Mesh 
	1. Choose your reference or sketch.
	2. Make a plan.
	3. Start from Polygon primitives (Create/Polygon Primitives).
	4. Use Deformation or Edit Mesh operations.
