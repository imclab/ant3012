# Maya Shading
## Lighting
### Indirect (global) vs. direct illumination	
![gl01](img/maya/shading/gl.png)

Indirect (Global illumination)light is all the inter-reflected light in a scene. Global illumination is an approximation of real-world indirect light transmission.

Direct (local) illumination is only the light provided directly from a light source (such as a spot light). Direct light is emitted from a light source and travels in a straight path to the illuminated point.

![gl02](img/maya/shading/illum.png)

Ray tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism, usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost.[-wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics))

### Cornell box
![cl01](img/maya/shading/cornell.png)

The Cornell box is a test aimed at determining the accuracy of rendering software by comparing the rendered scene with an actual photograph of the same scene, and has become a commonly used 3D test model. [-wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Box) 

Cornell box lighting examples: [1](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse557/08wi/projects/final/artifacts/jjohn-isdal/), [2](http://graphics.ucsd.edu/~henrik/images/cbox.html)
		
### Light sources in Maya		
Maya has a number of light sources that let you achieve a wide variety of lighting effects.
By default, Maya scenes do not contain light sources. However, Maya’s default lighting helps you to visualize objects in Shaded display in the scene view (press 5). If you turn default lighting off and have no lights in the scene, the scene appears black (see Default lighting in Maya for more information). By controlling its intensity, color and direction, light becomes a key factor in creating a scene in Maya.
With Maya, you have much more control over the placement, intensity, and characteristics of lights than you do with real-world lights. Shadows, specular highlights, diffuse, and glow all contribute to how light affects a scene.

#### Absorption, reflection, and refraction of light (Lighting and Shading > Lighting > Basics of Lighting > - [Maya Help](http://download.autodesk.com/global/docs/maya2014/en_us/)  ) 

The color of the objects we see in the natural world is a result of the way objects interact with light. When a light wave strikes an object, it can be absorbed, reflected, or refracted by the object. All objects have a degree of reflection and absorption.

![light07](img/maya/shading/refractionplus.png)

#### Light Decay (Lighting and Shading > Lighting > Basics of Lighting > Direct light sources > )

In the real world, a light’s brightness is strongest at the light source and decreases or decays further away from the light source. In Maya, a light’s brightness decays only if decay is turned on (see Decay Rate). The light’s color, however, remains the same no matter how far it is from the light source.

![decay01](img/maya/shading/decay.png)

You can also create decay effects not seen in the real world (only for a Spot light in Maya). For example, you can use a custom Intensity curve to make a spot light’s brightness increase further away from the light source, or you can use a custom Color curve to make the color of a spot light change with distance.

	- Color: black
	- Transparency: Value 0.9
	- Specular: Eccentricity 0.05, Specular Roll off 1.5, Color white, Reflectivity 0.2
	- Raytracing: check Refractions, Refractive Index 1.33, Refraction Limit more than 2

* **Refractive Index:** in optics, the refractive index or index of refraction n of a substance (optical medium) is a dimensionless number that describes how light, or any other radiation, propagates through that medium. For example, the refractive index of water is 1.33, meaning that light travels 1.33 times slower in water than it does in vacuum. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index)

# 1- , 2- , and 3- points lighting

## Goal
- Understand 3-point lighting
- Creating 1-, 2-, and 3- point lighting

### 3- points lighting components

**Key light**

The most intense light in a scene. The key light's source is generally identifiable (the sun, a lamp, and so on). The key light usually produces the strongest shadow in the scene.


**Fill light**

A secondary light that is less intense than the key. This light "fills" in the dark areas of a subject and the shadows produced by the key. Fill lights often represent light from a key that has bounced off a surface, such as a wall.


**Rim/Back/Hair light**

An intense light source placed behind a subject that strikes the subject along the edge. Rim lights are commonly known as backlights or hair lights.

## Using 3- points lighting
#### 1-Point Lighting
The 1-point lighting scheme is dramatic, sometimes stark, and often foreboding. The lighting involves a single, easily identifiable key light source, with no significant supplemental sources. 
#### 2-Point Lighting	
The 2-point lighting scheme matches many of the lighting scenarios we encounter in our everyday lives. The scheme often involves a strong key and an extremely diffuse fill.
#### 3-Point Lighting
The most commonly discussed and applied lighting technique is 3-point lighting. 
In the standard 3-point lighting scheme, a strong key is placed to one side of a subject (approximately 15 to 45 degrees off the camera axis). A fill light is placed on the opposite side and is at least half the intensity of the key. A rim light is placed behind the subject so that it grazes the subject's edge.
#### 4-point Lighting
Four-point lighting simply adds a fourth light to illuminate the background or set behind the subject.

### Practice
- Scene preparation: tip - using Grid snap + Modify/Center Pivot & Modify/Freeze Transformations
	1. a pedestal (a box or a cilinder)
	2. a suface back-wall (Create Curve & Loft)
	3. Import character bust or torso obj file (you can download from our class note or /GettingStarted2014LessonData/) 
	4. Align them to create a good studio environment
	
	Example studio
	
	![3pl02](img/maya/shading/lighting/studio.png)
	
>- Obj file

>	1. Open 'Toad_hi_res.mb' file from GettingStarted2014LessonData (GettingStarted2014LessonData/UVmapping) 
>	2. **Export** (File / Export Selection..) [.obj file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_OBJ) (first, you need load objExport.bundle from Window / Settings/Preferences / Plug-In Manager)
>	3. Save the obj file in the Data folder in your working Maya project
		
- Set-up the camera & render setting
- Applying Key light: once you make any light, the default Maya light will be turned off. recommend using Spot light (tip: position the Key light using Look Through Selected Camera from a view panel menu. In the Attribute Editor, change Cone Angle and Penumbra values, and select Depth Map Shadows (Resolution: 512, Filter Size: 4). Render a test)
- Applying Fill light: recommend using Ambient light
- Applying Back light: recommend using Directional light
- Experimentation: experiment to create your style and to fit to your goal/intention.
