# Maya Shading
## Lighting
### Indirect (global) vs. direct illumination	
![gl01](img/maya/shading/gl.png)

Indirect (Global illumination)light is all the inter-reflected light in a scene. Global illumination is an approximation of real-world indirect light transmission.

Direct (local) illumination is only the light provided directly from a light source (such as a spot light). Direct light is emitted from a light source and travels in a straight path to the illuminated point.

Ray tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism, usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost.[-wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics))
		
### Light sources in Maya		
Maya has a number of light sources that let you achieve a wide variety of lighting effects.
By default, Maya scenes do not contain light sources. However, Maya’s default lighting helps you to visualize objects in Shaded display in the scene view (press 5). If you turn default lighting off and have no lights in the scene, the scene appears black (see Default lighting in Maya for more information). By controlling its intensity, color and direction, light becomes a key factor in creating a scene in Maya.
With Maya, you have much more control over the placement, intensity, and characteristics of lights than you do with real-world lights. Shadows, specular highlights, diffuse, and glow all contribute to how light affects a scene.

#### Absorption, reflection, and refraction of light (Lighting and Shading > Lighting > Basics of Lighting > - [Maya Help](http://download.autodesk.com/global/docs/maya2014/en_us/)  ) 

The color of the objects we see in the natural world is a result of the way objects interact with light. When a light wave strikes an object, it can be absorbed, reflected, or refracted by the object. All objects have a degree of reflection and absorption.

#### Light Decay (Lighting and Shading > Lighting > Basics of Lighting > Direct light sources > )

In the real world, a light’s brightness is strongest at the light source and decreases or decays further away from the light source. In Maya, a light’s brightness decays only if decay is turned on (see Decay Rate). The light’s color, however, remains the same no matter how far it is from the light source.

![decay01](img/maya/shading/decay.png)

You can also create decay effects not seen in the real world (only for a Spot light in Maya). For example, you can use a custom Intensity curve to make a spot light’s brightness increase further away from the light source, or you can use a custom Color curve to make the color of a spot light change with distance.

### Creating Shadows
- Define from light sources.

### Creating Soft Shadow

Example of depth map soft shadow: increase the filter size.

## Materials
### Creating Materials and Textures	
#### Different materials

#### Hypershade Editor

## Camera properties:

- Create a camera with a aim (Create/Cameras/Camera and Aim) and check it at the Outliner (two plane mode -> at the left panel or panels/Layouts/Two Panes Side by Side).
- Choose the camera and transform Snapping the Aim to the main focus point of the object). 
- Adjust the position of camera (panels/Look through Selected)
- Choosing Camera properties: (select Camera -> Attribute Editor)	
	- Angle of View, Near and Far clip, Film Gate   
	  	
	![sp03](img/maya/shading/camera.png)
	
## Reder Settings
To render the scene, check the Render Settings.(Window/Rendering Editors/Render Settings)
	
- Work on Common settings
	- File name, Image format, Choose camera, Choose Image Size		
	![sp01](img/maya/shading/render_common.png)
		
- Work on specific renderer settings -> Maya Software
	- Quality, Anti-aliasing, Raytracing, Motion Blur    
	![sp02](img/maya/shading/render_maya.png)

## Mid-term
- **April 23rd: Quiz**

- Submit **a folder** including 1. a rendering image (Full HD: 1024 * 768, using one of jpg / png / tif) of your room (naturally) or object (unique), 2. one pdf showing your sketch + research/references. 
- Please name your folder as: **school id_your name\_submission date\_midterm**
- Please name all your documentation as: **your name\_submission date\_title** 
- Due date: submit to **yoon_goo@naver.com** by **April 27th Friday 12pm.**	

Your mid-term grade criteria: Quiz (10) + Your mid-term project (50) + one pdf of your inspirational work (10) + assignments (1. NURBs glass 2. NURBs cup 3. Apple 4. 3D text with boolean operation 5. desk sketch 6. studio rendering) (30)

### Assignment 
Finish & submit your studio rendering after working on distinguishable materials and proper light set-up to Tumblr and send it with your mid-term project.

### Next class will be April 30th
