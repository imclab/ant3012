# Maya Shading II
## Working on the Cornell Box

**The Cornell box** is a test aimed at determining the accuracy of rendering software by comparing the rendered scene with an actual photograph of the same scene, and has become a commonly used 3D test model. [-wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Box)

## Material: Glass (& Mirror)

![glass01](img/maya/shading/teapotGlass.png)

### Creating Glass material

1. **Find references** such as photographs of a physical glass.	
	[Example of glass material reference](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2012/08/a-glass-sphere-solar-energy-generator-capable-of-converting-sun-and-moonlight-into-usable-power/)
	
2. **In the Hyprshade in Maya**:     
assign the **Blinn.** Then open & change its attributes as follows:
	- Color: black
	- Transparency: Value 0.9
	- Specular: Eccentricity 0.05, Specular Roll off 1.5, Color white, Reflectivity 0.2
	- Raytracing: check Refractions, Refractive Index 1.33, Refraction Limit more than 2
	
	![glass02](img/maya/shading/glass.png)

* **Refractive Index:** in optics, the refractive index or index of refraction n of a substance (optical medium) is a dimensionless number that describes how light, or any other radiation, propagates through that medium. For example, the refractive index of water is 1.33, meaning that light travels 1.33 times slower in water than it does in vacuum. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index)

3. Render Settings: turn on the Raytracing attribute

Lighting & Soft Shadow

## Homework
- Submit your Cornell box to Tumblr by next class. 
- Research on glass material.

# 1- , 2- , and 3- points lighting

## Goal
- Understand 3-point lighting
- Creating 1-, 2-, and 3- point lighting

### 3- points lighting components

**Key light**

The most intense light in a scene. The key light's source is generally identifiable (the sun, a lamp, and so on). The key light usually produces the strongest shadow in the scene.


**Fill light**

A secondary light that is less intense than the key. This light "fills" in the dark areas of a subject and the shadows produced by the key. Fill lights often represent light from a key that has bounced off a surface, such as a wall.


**Rim/Back/Hair light**

An intense light source placed behind a subject that strikes the subject along the edge. Rim lights are commonly known as backlights or hair lights.

## Using 3- points lighting
#### 1-Point Lighting
The 1-point lighting scheme is dramatic, sometimes stark, and often foreboding. The lighting involves a single, easily identifiable key light source, with no significant supplemental sources. 
#### 2-Point Lighting	
The 2-point lighting scheme matches many of the lighting scenarios we encounter in our everyday lives. The scheme often involves a strong key and an extremely diffuse fill.
#### 3-Point Lighting
The most commonly discussed and applied lighting technique is 3-point lighting. 
In the standard 3-point lighting scheme, a strong key is placed to one side of a subject (approximately 15 to 45 degrees off the camera axis). A fill light is placed on the opposite side and is at least half the intensity of the key. A rim light is placed behind the subject so that it grazes the subject's edge.
#### 4-point Lighting
Four-point lighting simply adds a fourth light to illuminate the background or set behind the subject.

### Practice
- Scene preparation: tip - using Grid snap + Modify/Center Pivot & Modify/Freeze Transformations
	1. a pedestal (a box or a cilinder)
	2. a suface back-wall (Create Curve & Loft)
	3. Import character bust or torso obj file (you can download from our class note or /GettingStarted2014LessonData/) 
	4. Align them to create a good studio environment
	
	Example studio
	
	![3pl02](img/maya/shading/lighting/studio.png)
	
>- Obj file

>	1. Open 'Toad_hi_res.mb' file from GettingStarted2014LessonData (GettingStarted2014LessonData/UVmapping) 
>	2. **Export** (File / Export Selection..) [.obj file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_OBJ) (first, you need load objExport.bundle from Window / Settings/Preferences / Plug-In Manager)
>	3. Save the obj file in the Data folder in your working Maya project
		
- Set-up the camera & render setting
- Applying Key light: once you make any light, the default Maya light will be turned off. recommend using Spot light (tip: position the Key light using Look Through Selected Camera from a view panel menu. In the Attribute Editor, change Cone Angle and Penumbra values, and select Depth Map Shadows (Resolution: 512, Filter Size: 4). Render a test)
- Applying Fill light: recommend using Ambient light
- Applying Back light: recommend using Directional light
- Experimentation: experiment to create your style and to fit to your goal/intention.

## Light test

### Check one light each time (in the Light Attributes):
- Turn on/off Illuminates by default.
- Change the light Color

![test01](img/maya/shading/lighting/test01.png)

#### Change more attributes in the Spot Light Attributes.
- Decay Rate, Cone Angle, Penumbra Angle, Dropoff

![test04](img/maya/shading/lighting/test04.png)

![test03](img/maya/shading/lighting/test03.png)

![test044](img/maya/shading/lighting/lightstructure.jpg)

#### Let's practice more!

![test05](img/maya/shading/lighting/test05.png)

## Homework
- Submit **your three-point lighting rendering result to Tumblr by next class.
