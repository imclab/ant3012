# Introduction to 3D Modeling and Texturing  
[digital] Modeling by William Vaughan, 2011

### What is digital modeling?

- **Digital modeling (3D model, 3D mesh, or  3D modeling)** refers to the process of creating a mathematical representation of a three-dimensional shape of an object. You can create 3D models manually generated, or automatically scanned.

- You see 3D graphics literally everywhere these days. Digital modelers work in television and feature flms, game design, medical illustration and animation, print graphics, product and architectural visualization, and many other markets.

###  A few advices to a becoming 3D modeler


- **Problem-solving** and **observational skills** are most important: to be successful in this feld, you need to become a problem solver with good observation skills and a desire to create things. You never stop learning in this feld. You face new challenges with every new project, many of which require innovative solutions that you must discover on your own. If you get to a point where you stop seeing these challenges as lessons that help build your ever-growing skill set, it’s probably a sign that you’ve lost your passion for the medium and it may be time to explore other career options.

- Software: whether the software is free, cheap, or super expensive, artists are creating amazing pieces of art with it. Don’t get too caught up in software, because throughout your career as a digital artist you will most likely use various modeling and sculpting applications. Each comes with its own workfow, but the core fundamentals of modeling stay the same.

- **Job Market:** according to the BLS (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), the job market for multimedia artists and animators was expected to grow 8% from 2010-2020. With large numbers of self-employment 3D artists and the intense competition for salaried positions, earnings vary widely and are difficult to predict. The BLS reported that the median annual salary for multimedia artists and animators was $61,370 in May 2012.

### Understanding a Modeler’s role 

- It’s all about teamwork. To truly master digital modeling, you must be aware of all aspects of production and understand how they are connected. Projects that require digital modeling come in all shapes and sizes, and can require a team made up of just one artist or hundreds of artists.

- **Production Pipelines:** Stages of Production

	3 Stages:  no matter the size of the team or project, you will need a strong production pipeline.   
	
	![3 Stages](img/pipeline.png)

	- __Pre-production:__ the pre-production stage is the process of preparing all the elements involved in a production and is the foundation of the project—the blueprint of the entire animation. The story and visual look of a project is developed at this stage, as well as the overall planning of the production.    
	- __Production:__ the production phase of the project is where fnal elements of the animation are initially created based on the work developed by the pre-production crew. It is the production crew’s job to stay true to the blueprint in place and to maintain the director’s vision. It’s also where the digital modeler comes into play in most production pipelines.
	- __Post-production:__the post-production is the part of the process that may take the longest due to the refnement of all of the aspects of the fnal product. Although this is the last step in the production of an animation, it is key to a project’s success. Images get enhanced by compositing, the sound track and dialogue get tighter, and the edit gets tweaked for the most effective presentation of story and pacing. This is the point of the project that can make or break it and should not be taken lightly. It is what the production team loses the most sleep over.
