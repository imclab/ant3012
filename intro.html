### What is digital modeling?

- **Digital modeling (3D model, 3D mesh, or  3D modeling)** refers to the process of creating a mathematical representation of a three-dimensional shape of an object. You can create 3D models manually generated, or automatically scanned.

- You see 3D graphics literally everywhere these days. Digital modelers work in television and feature flms, game design, medical illustration and animation, print graphics, product and architectural visualization, and many other markets.

###  A few advices to a becoming 3D modeler


- **Problem-solving** and **observational skills** are most important: to be successful in this feld, you need to become a problem solver with good observation skills and a desire to create things. You never stop learning in this feld. You face new challenges with every new project, many of which require innovative solutions that you must discover on your own. If you get to a point where you stop seeing these challenges as lessons that help build your ever-growing skill set, it’s probably a sign that you’ve lost your passion for the medium and it may be time to explore other career options.

- Software: whether the software is free, cheap, or super expensive, artists are creating amazing pieces of art with it. Don’t get too caught up in software, because throughout your career as a digital artist you will most likely use various modeling and sculpting applications. Each comes with its own workfow, but the core fundamentals of modeling stay the same.

- **Job Market:** according to the BLS (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), the job market for multimedia artists and animators was expected to grow 8% from 2010-2020. With large numbers of self-employment 3D artists and the intense competition for salaried positions, earnings vary widely and are difficult to predict. The BLS reported that the median annual salary for multimedia artists and animators was $61,370 in May 2012.

### Understanding a Modeler’s role 

- It’s all about teamwork. To truly master digital modeling, you must be aware of all aspects of production and understand how they are connected. Projects that require digital modeling come in all shapes and sizes, and can require a team made up of just one artist or hundreds of artists.

- **Production Pipelines:** Stages of Production

	3 Stages:  no matter the size of the team or project, you will need a strong production pipeline.   
	
	>  ![3 Stages](img/pipeline.png)

	- __Pre-production:__ the pre-production stage is the process of preparing all the elements involved in a production and is the foundation of the project—the blueprint of the entire animation. The story and visual look of a project is developed at this stage, as well as the overall planning of the production.    
	- __Production:__ the production phase of the project is where fnal elements of the animation are initially created based on the work developed by the pre-production crew. It is the production crew’s job to stay true to the blueprint in place and to maintain the director’s vision. It’s also where the digital modeler comes into play in most production pipelines.
	- __Post-production:__the post-production is the part of the process that may take the longest due to the refnement of all of the aspects of the fnal product. Although this is the last step in the production of an animation, it is key to a project’s success. Images get enhanced by compositing, the sound track and dialogue get tighter, and the edit gets tweaked for the most effective presentation of story and pacing. This is the point of the project that can make or break it and should not be taken lightly. It is what the production team loses the most sleep over.

## Computer/Digital Modeling Methods

>An interesting fact in the digital modeling world is that no two artists use the same techniques when creating a digital model, even when the two modelers are working from the same reference material, producing the same final mesh. Consider this example: When I had classes of thirty students working on the same robot model, I never saw any two working with the same method. This just goes to show that there is no set way to work, and that artists are free to work with whatever method(s) they feel most comfortable with.

![robots](img/meth/robots.png)

>Don’t limit yourself to just a few modeling methods. Every professional digital modeler I know gravitates to a particular method of modeling for the majority of the meshes each is tasked with, but each modeler is quick to use other methods when needed. The more techniques you become proficient in, the more efficient you will become.

>No consideration to the layout of polygons is needed when digital sculpting, leaving the artist’s focus on the shapes, not the underlying geometry.

>The high-poly meshes are used as source material to enhance low-poly models used in real-time games with the use of normal maps.

>### Toplogy  
>####[Wolfram mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Topology.html), [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
>- Topology: (1) The mathematical study of object's properties that are preserved through **deformations**, **twistings**, and **stretchings**. (2) A set along with a collection of subsets that satisfy several defining properties. [Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/classroom/TopologicalSpace.html)

>- Topology is the mathematical study of the properties that are preserved through deformations, twistings, and stretchings of objects. Tearing, however, is not allowed. 
- Q: What is a topologist? A: Someone who cannot distinguish between a doughnut and a coffee cup. 

>- Topology is the mathematical study of **shapes** and **spaces**. It is a major area of mathematics concerned with the most basic properties of space, such as *connectedness*, *continuity* and *boundary*. It is the study of properties that are preserved under continuous deformations including stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. The exact mathematical definition is given below. Topology developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of such concepts as space, dimension, and transformation. e.g. Möbius strips is a kind of object studied in topology, which has only one surface and one edge.
