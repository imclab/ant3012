# Virtual Filmmaking  

Mastering Autodesk Maya 2013 Chapter 2    
Help file [Maya 2014 online    Help](http://download.autodesk.com/global/docs/maya2014/en_us/), [Maya tutorial files](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=9502844&linkID=9242256)

### The virtual cameras in Maya.
>*As with all filmmaking, the story is told through the camera.*

Although the technical aspects of using the cameras are not difficult to learn, mastering the art of virtual cinematography can take years of practice.

### Practice in Maya

1. Determine the image size and film speed of the camera
	- The final size of the rendered image (image sequence) as well as the film speed (frames per second). 
	- Render Settings window
		- Image size: the number of pixels on the horizontal axis by the number of pixels on the vertical axis. 
		- Resolution: how many pixels fit within an inch. (Computer screen resolution vs. Print resolution)
		- Image Aspect Ratio: the ratio of width over height. An image that is 720 by 540 has a ratio of 1.333.
		- Pixel Aspect Ratio: the ratio of the actual pixel size. Computer monitors use square pixels: the height of the pixel is 1, and the width of the pixel is 1; thus, the pixel aspect ratio is 1. Standard video images use nonsquare pixels that are 1 pixel high by 1.1 pixels wide, giving them a pixel aspect ratio of 0.9.
		- Device Aspect Ratio: the image aspect ratio multiplied by the pixel aspect ratio. For a video image that is 720 by 486 (1.48) using nonsquare pixels (0.9), this would be 1.48 Ã— 0.9 = 1.333.

2. Create and animate cameras
	- When you add a camera to a scene, you should imagine how the shot will be composed and whether the camera will be animated. 
	> ***Animatics***    
	> An animatic is a film industry term referring to a rough animation designed to help plan a shot, like a moving storyboard. Typically, models in an animatic are very low resolution and untextured with simple lighting. Animatics are used to plan both computer-generated (CG) and live-action shots. Camera work, timing, and the composition of elements within the frame are the most important aspects of an animatic.
		
- Use depth of field and motion blur

### Depth of Field (DoF) rendering

#### Scene preparation
 
1. Create three plane and five balls on the Cylinder (Create/Polygon Primitives & Edit/Duplicate Special) and align them.
2. Create a camera with a aim (Create/Cameras/Camera and Aim) and check it at the Outliner (two plane mode -> at the left panel or panels/Layouts/Two Panes Side by Side).
3. Choose the camera and transform Snapping the Aim to the main focus point of the object). 
4. Adjust the position of camera (panels/Look through Selected)
- Choosing Camera properties: (select Camera -> Attribute Editor)	
	- Angle of View, Near and Far clip, Film Gate

5. Measure the distance between main object to the camera (Create/Measure Tools/Distance Tool)
6. Use the distance for the Focus Distance in the Attribute Editor of the camera
	- Check Depth of Field (select Camera -> Attribute Editor), change the Focus Distance and F Stop

7. Render the scene. Do the basic render settings.
	- Choosing Rendering properties: (Window/Rendering Editors/Render Settings)
	- Work on Common settings
		- File name, Image format, Choose camera, Choose Image Size
		![sp01](img/maya/shading/render_common.png)
		
	- Work on Specific settings -> Maya Software
		- Quality, Anti-aliasing, Raytracing, Motion Blur
