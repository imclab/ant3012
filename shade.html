- ADs (supplementary class and so on) + feedback

## Next Class
- More practices
- 3 Point Lighting
- More on Texturing
- Rendering

## Mid-term project
- A rendering picture (Full HD: 1024 * 768) of still life with your sign and title.   
	Option: your sketch + research/references
	
## Camera properties

- Create a camera with a aim (Create/Cameras/Camera and Aim) and check it at the Outliner (two plane mode -> at the left panel or panels/Layouts/Two Panes Side by Side).
- Choose the camera and transform Snapping the Aim to the main focus point of the object). 
- Adjust the position of camera (panels/Look through Selected)
- Choosing Camera properties: (select Camera -> Attribute Editor)	
	- Angle of View, Near and Far clip, Film Gate   
	  	
	![sp03](img/maya/shading/camera.png)
	
- To render the scene, check the Render Settings.(Window/Rendering Editors/Render Settings)
	- Work on Common settings
		- File name, Image format, Choose camera, Choose Image Size
		
		![sp01](img/maya/shading/render_common.png)
		
	- Work on specific renderer settings -> Maya Software
		- Quality, Anti-aliasing, Raytracing, Motion Blur
		
		![sp02](img/maya/shading/render_maya.png)
		
- Cleaning the scene (grouping, naming, delete History): preparing next progresses or more complicated works

- Preparing the portfolio (group vs. individual)

# Working on the Cornell Box

## Goal
- Make Soft Shadow
- Lighting: using main and an ambient light
- Lighting: three-point light [3-point lighting](http://www.3drender.com/light/3point.html)

### Making  
1. Open the Cornell Box scene and Save As as title_02
2. Create **Soft Shadow** using Depth Map Shadow
3. Create **Soft Shadow** using Raytracing
4. Modify Glass and Mirror ball shading attributes

### Goal Rendering Image

Lighting & Soft Shadow

### Reference attributes example of glass

1. Find a photograph of a glass for reference	
2. Material Attribute Editor (Hypershade):
	- Color: black
	- Transparency: Value 0.9
	- Specular: Eccentricity 0.05, Specular Roll off 1.5, Color white, Reflectivity 0.2
	- Raytracing: check Refractions, Refractive Index 1.33, Refraction Limit more than 2
3. Render Settings: turn on the Raytracing attribute

* **Refractive Index:** in optics, the refractive index or index of refraction n of a substance (optical medium) is a dimensionless number that describes how light, or any other radiation, propagates through that medium. For example, the refractive index of water is 1.33, meaning that light travels 1.33 times slower in water than it does in vacuum. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index)

# 1- , 2- , and 3- points lighting

## Goal
- Understand 3-point lighting
- Creating 1-, 2-, and 3- point lighting

### 3- points lighting components

**Key light**

The most intense light in a scene. The key light's source is generally identifiable (the sun, a lamp, and so on). The key light usually produces the strongest shadow in the scene.


**Fill light**

A secondary light that is less intense than the key. This light "fills" in the dark areas of a subject and the shadows produced by the key. Fill lights often represent light from a key that has bounced off a surface, such as a wall.


**Rim/Back/Hair light**

An intense light source placed behind a subject that strikes the subject along the edge. Rim lights are commonly known as backlights or hair lights.

## Using 3- points lighting
#### 1-Point Lighting
The 1-point lighting scheme is dramatic, sometimes stark, and often foreboding. The lighting involves a single, easily identifiable key light source, with no significant supplemental sources. 
#### 2-Point Lighting	
The 2-point lighting scheme matches many of the lighting scenarios we encounter in our everyday lives. The scheme often involves a strong key and an extremely diffuse fill.
#### 3-Point Lighting
The most commonly discussed and applied lighting technique is 3-point lighting. 
In the standard 3-point lighting scheme, a strong key is placed to one side of a subject (approximately 15 to 45 degrees off the camera axis). A fill light is placed on the opposite side and is at least half the intensity of the key. A rim light is placed behind the subject so that it grazes the subject's edge.
#### 4-point Lighting
Four-point lighting simply adds a fourth light to illuminate the background or set behind the subject.

### Practice
- Scene preparation: tip - using Grid snap + Modify/Center Pivot & Modify/Freeze Transformations
	1. a pedestal (a box or a cilinder)
	2. a suface back-wall (Create Curve & Loft)
	3. Import character bust or torso obj file (you can download from our class note or /GettingStarted2014LessonData/) 
	4. Align them to create a good studio environment
	
	Example studio
	
	![3pl02](img/maya/shading/lighting/studio.png)
	
>- Obj file

>	1. Open 'Toad_hi_res.mb' file from GettingStarted2014LessonData (GettingStarted2014LessonData/UVmapping) 
>	2. **Export** (File / Export Selection..) [.obj file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_OBJ) (first, you need load objExport.bundle from Window / Settings/Preferences / Plug-In Manager)
>	3. Save the obj file in the Data folder in your working Maya project
		
- Set-up the camera & render setting
- Applying Key light: once you make any light, the default Maya light will be turned off. recommend using Spot light (tip: position the Key light using Look Through Selected Camera from a view panel menu. In the Attribute Editor, change Cone Angle and Penumbra values, and select Depth Map Shadows (Resolution: 512, Filter Size: 4). Render a test)
- Applying Fill light: recommend using Ambient light
- Applying Back light: recommend using Directional light
- Experimentation: experiment to create your style and to fit to your goal/intention.

### Light test

#### Check one light each time (in the Light Attributes):
- Turn on/off Illuminates by default.
- Change the light Color

#### Change more attributes in the Spot Light Attributes.
- Decay Rate, Cone Angle, Penumbra Angle, Dropoff

![test04](img/maya/shading/lighting/test04.png)
![test02](img/maya/shading/lighting/test02.png)
![test03](img/maya/shading/lighting/test03.png)

#### Practice more

![test05](img/maya/shading/lighting/test05.png)

## AD/Next Class
