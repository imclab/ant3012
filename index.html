# 3D Modeling and Texturing  
2013 2nd semester

**Course Number:** ANT3012  
**Credit:** 3  
**Enrollment Eligibility:** 2, 3, 4  
**Class Time:** Wed 13:30~14:45, Fri 13:30~14:45    
**Classroom:** X427  
**Webpage:** http://jiharu.github.io/ant3012/   
**Instructors:** HyunKyung (Haru) Ji  
**Office:** X407 (Tue 14:00~16:00, Fri 15:00~17:00)

The goal of this class is for students to learn both practical and theoretical knowledge in digital modeling and texturing. During the class, we will broadly expand our subjects from digital modeling to shading, digital cinematography, and MEL (Maya Embedded Language) modeling. 
This approach will widely expand students’ creative production abilities.

In the class, we will primarily use ***Autodesk Maya***, which has very strong support on modeling as well as other related production pipeline.

The class covers from a beginner level to an intermediate level. Students will do a small assignment each week, and for the mid- and final-term evaluation, they will submit one Maya modeling project along with quiz respectively.

Students will learn: 

- Theoretical and practical points such as: understanding 3D computer graphics / various kinds of digital modeling methods / production workflow focused on modeler’s role / Maya interface and structure / Maya NURBs, Polygon, Subdivision modeling / Shading including Texturing / UV / Deformers & Blend Shape / simple Mel / digital cinematography / Global Illumination at mostly basic to intermediate level.

### Prerequisites 

Nothing but willing motivation.

### Course format

This class takes a workshop format. Half of the class will be lecture-based, showing the theory and practice using presentation media and software (50%) with discussed feedback (10%). The other half will be practice-based, oriented toward work by students (40%).

Students will share their homework through the website such as Tumblr. Questions and discussions are encouraged during the class time.

There will be at least one guest lecture.

### Evaluation

- Small assignments every week to evaluate how students follow the each week’s topics (20%). 
- Mid-term: one creative Maya NURBs modeling project + quiz (30% + 10%). 
- Final-term: one creative Maya character modeling project (30% + 10%).

When you submit your work, please name your assignment as the following format: *yourSchoolid\_name\_date.extension*

### Course policies

Notice with apology:

This year, the school cannot provide Maya licenses for the class. However you can install Maya academic version on your personal computer. Therefore, **bring your laptop with a three button mouse to the class.**

**On both 9/4 and 9/6, there will be no class** because Prof. Ji will have an official trip to Austria Linz; she will compensate for those later using her office time or in class. For about 15 mins each at the class, the class TA will be in assistance for any query.

Sorry for your inconvenience.

Using the software:   

- You can download Maya software for educational purpose on your personal computer for free: http://students.autodesk.com/?nd=download_center   
Create your account and choose Maya2014 to download & install.  

- Support for the disabled: seat support/ Extensions on homework’s and project submissions/ TA support etc.
