# 3D Modeling and Texturing  
Spring 2014

**Course Number:** ANT3012  
**Credit:** 3  
**Enrollment Eligibility:** 2, 3, 4  
**Class Time:** Wed 13:30~14:45, Fri 13:30~14:45    
**Classroom:**   
**Webpage:** [http://jiharu.github.io/ant3012/](http://jiharu.github.io/ant3012/)     
**Class portfolio website:** [http://2014ant3012.tumblr.com/](http://2014ant3012.tumblr.com/)   
**Instructors:** HyunKyung (Haru) Ji  
**Office:** X407 (Tue 14:00~16:00, Fri 15:00~17:00)

The goal of this class is for students to learn both practical and theoretical knowledge in digital modeling and texturing. During the class, we will broadly expand our subjects from modeling to shading, digital cinematography, and special effects in Maya. This approach will widely expand students’ creative production abilities. 

In the class, we will primarily use **Autodesk Maya**, which has very strong support on modeling as well as other related production pipeline.

The class covers from a beginner level to an intermediate level. Evaluation will be based on quiz and projects based on creative approach to 3D modeling and texturing expression. 

Students will learn: 

- Theoretical and practical points such as: understanding 3D computer graphics / various kinds of digital modeling methods / production workflow focused on modeler’s role / Maya interface and structure / Maya NURBs, Polygon, Subdivision modeling / Shading including Texturing / UV / Deformers & Blend Shape / digital cinematography / Global Illumination. 

### Prerequisites 

Nothing but willing motivation.

### Course format

This class takes a workshop format. Half of the class will be lecture-based, showing the theory and practice using presentation media and software (50%) with discussed feedback (10%). The other half will be practice-based, oriented toward work by students (40%). 

Students will share their homework through the Tumblr website (http://2014ant3012.tumblr.com/). Questions and discussions are encouraged during the class time.

### Evaluation

- Assignments to evaluate how students follow the each topics (40%).
- Mid-term: one creative modeling & texturing project + quiz (20% + 10%).
- Final-term: one creative modeling & texturing project (30%). 

When you submit your work, please name your assignment as the following format: *yourSchoolid\_name\_date.extension*

### Course policies

Notice with apology:

This year, the school cannot provide Maya licenses for the class. However you can install Maya academic version on your personal computer. Therefore, **bring your laptop with a three button mouse to the class.**

Sorry for your inconvenience.

Using the software:   

- You can download Maya software for educational purpose on your personal computer for free: http://students.autodesk.com/?nd=download_center   
Create your account and choose Maya2014 to download & install.  

- Support for the disabled: seat support/ Extensions on homework’s and project submissions/ TA support etc.

### Next Class
Introduction to 3D Modeling and Texturing (Don't need a laptop yet)

### Homework (by Mar 9 Sunday midnight)
Submit one pdf to show your research on inspirational 3D modeling masterworks. (Recommend one to two paragraphs and a few pictures and references!) Please use the submission format. **ex) 2014xxxx(school id)\_윤구용(name)\_0307(submission date).pdf(extension)** and submit to **yoon\_goo@naver.com** by **March 9th**. It is Sunday.
